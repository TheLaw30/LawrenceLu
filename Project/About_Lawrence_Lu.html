<h2>What Is Your Story?</h2>
<p>Hello I am Lawrence Lu. I grew up in Oakland and logically go to school at Oakland tech. I used to go to Lighthouse community charter school but switched in 10th grade. I love books and that's about all of my life.

  </p>
  <p>
    If I could have one super power it would be to be able to have all the time in the world so I could learn all the piano songs that I want.
  </p>
  <p> If I could live anywhere in the world it would have to be in a tropical area like hawaii, I've always wanted to visit some sunny beaches with very clear water.
   </p>
   <p> If I could eat one food for the rest of my life, sushi, cuz it's A'mazing</p>
