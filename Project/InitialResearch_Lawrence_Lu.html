    Problem Statement

    <p>
    The rate and effects of reading for the youth is continuing to plunder as the age of technology reduces the attention spans and interest of people while poverty reduces the access that children have to books.

      Need Statement
    </h1>
  <p>
    Education is the major solution to communities who are impoverished, however, because they don’t have the resources and funding to receive the schooling necessary for college, degrees, and higher education they continue to fall into the vicious cycle of poverty. Books and increases in reading would benefit these communities because they would not only boost the education of the youth, but they would also incentivise social cohesion that lacks so much in our day and age.

Forty-five million. That’s how many words a typical child in a white-collar family will hear before age 4. The number is striking, not because it’s a lot of words for such a small human—the vast majority of a person’s neural connections, after all, are formed by age 3—but because of how it stacks up against a poor kid’s exposure to vocabulary. By the time she’s 4, a child on welfare might only have heard 13 million words.

      Children and students are now reading less and less in their youth, never challenging their reading comprehension and reading skills and levels. Although it mainly affects youth, this also affects young adults along with older adults who no longer participate in reading clubs or discussions. LAck of book interest now.    To find out what children are reading, I conducted a study of 963,678 students in 4,364 schools across the UK. I found that from 2016 to 2017, students read 18,044,078 books: it sounds like a lot, but when I dug down into the data, I found some worrying trends.

  In fact, 1 in 3 U.S. high school seniors did not read a book for pleasure in 2016. In the same time period, 82 percent of 12th-graders visited sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram every day.      For her, the most important discovery hidden in the data is this statistic: In the 1970s, about 60 percent of high school seniors reported reading a book, magazine or newspaper every single day. Four decades later, in 2016, 16 percent of high school seniors reported doing so.
